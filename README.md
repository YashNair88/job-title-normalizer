# job-title-normalizer

The Job Title Normalizer is a web-based application designed to automatically clean and standardize job titles from Excel or CSV files. It combines rule-based mapping with semantic similarity using transformer embeddings to ensure accuracy and consistency across datasets.

Messy or inconsistent job titles—such as hk supervisor, carpendar, or jr executive—are normalized to their canonical forms like Housekeeping Supervisor, Carpenter, and Junior Executive. This helps maintain data integrity and supports cleaner analytics and reporting pipelines.
